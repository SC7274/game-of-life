The Game of Life project is a simulation of a cellular automaton created by John Horton Conway. It consists of a grid of cells, where each cell can be either "alive" or "dead." The state of the cells changes over time based on a set of rules that determine how the cells interact with each other. 
In this project, the grid is represented by a 2-dimensional array, and the state of the cells is determined by the values in the array. The user can interact with the grid by clicking on cells, which toggle the state of that cell from "alive" to "dead" or vice versa. The user can also start and stop the simulation, which automatically updates the state of the cells based on the rules of the Game of Life. The project is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and it uses functional components and hooks to manage the state of the grid and the simulation.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
